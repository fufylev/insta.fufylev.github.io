# Lite version of Instagram as part of my JS+React training
In order to solidify my skills in React and NodeJS, I decided to build a sort of lite version of Instagram. This is a Client-Server application with various stack: HTML, CSS+SASS (modules), JavaScript (ES6-9), React JS + Redux, NodeJS, Saga and other middlewares. As a result, I am expecting the following features:
1. Registration and Authorization
2.  Home page with pictures scrolling 
3. User's pages
4. Add posts and photographs
5. TBA
