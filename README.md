Unfortunately, I decided to postpone this small project as I faced a bunch of problems regards Google FireBase and 
eventually I realized that it was a mistake to use it as it was hard to send precise queries for a particular 
endpoint and receive back exactly what I was needed. I had to use a sort of middleware code in order to clarify to 
FireBase what I need, and, therefore, the code became more and more unreadable. 

New version of the app you will find [here](https://github.com/fufylev/lite-insta-v2)

### Lite version of Instagram as part of my JS+React training

In order to solidify my skills in React and NodeJS, I decided to build a sort of lite version of Instagram. 
This is a Client-Server application with various stack: HTML, CSS+SASS (modules), JavaScript (ES6-9), 
React JS + Redux, NodeJS, Saga and other middlewares. As a result, I am expecting the following features:
* [Registration and Authorization](https://github.com/fufylev/lite_instagram/tree/master/client/app/modules/Authentication)
* [Home page](https://github.com/fufylev/lite_instagram/tree/master/client/app/modules/PicturesGallary) with pictures' scrolling
* [User's](https://github.com/fufylev/lite_instagram/tree/master/client/app/modules/User) page
* Photo's commenting and liking
