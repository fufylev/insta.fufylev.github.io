## Lite version of Instagram as part of my JS+React training

In order to solidify my skills in React and NodeJS, I decided to build a sort of lite version of Instagram. 
This is a Client-Server application with various stack: HTML, CSS+SASS (modules), JavaScript (ES6-9), 
React JS + Redux, NodeJS, Saga and other middlewares. As a result, I am expecting the following features:
* [Registration and Authorization](https://github.com/fufylev/lite_instagram/tree/master/client/app/modules/Authentication)
* [Home page](https://github.com/fufylev/lite_instagram/tree/master/client/app/modules/PicturesGallary) with pictures' scrolling
* [User's](https://github.com/fufylev/lite_instagram/tree/master/client/app/modules/User) page
* Photo's commenting and liking
